Sleeper – analysis of sleep quality

A lot of people have the problem of waking up hard and exhaustion in the morning. A long-lasting sleep doesn’t guarantee that the person will wake up fresh. This is mainly caused by low-quality sleep. The issue is that people can’t observe their own sleep and this project’s goal is to give the user information about that.

The project consists of a hardware device, based on Arduino Uno, and an  analysing software coded on Python. The system keeps track of the body’s movements throughout the night (an indicator of bad sleep) and the level of sound caused by snorting.

The project helps people find the cases in which their sleep is bad (after overeating or alcohol drinking, for example) or good, whether they snort throughout the whole night or just during some periods of it.
